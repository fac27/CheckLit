# CheckLit

A FAC project using test-driven-development methods. ``CheckLit`` is an online check list tool that users can update and modify.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repo is to document and collaborate on ``CheckLit`` using asynchronous working methods.

### User stories

As a user, I want to:
- Create and view multiple checklists
- Add and delete items from my lists
- Mark items as completed
- Remove entire lists from the page
- View checklists on all my devices

### Instructions

- Download CheckLit files
``git clone https://github.com/fac27/CheckLit main``
- Open CheckLit files in your editor
- Install vsCode ```LiveServer``` or equivalent to view the CheckLit UI. Alternatively, open ```index.html``` from your local library.

### Learning objectives

#### Testing 
[x] Check that passing a given input into our tests returns the expected output

[x] Write tests to mimic the behaviour of a user performing different action

We developed a testing library to test that the user stories were met. Each test mimics the necessary user actions prior to the event. The tests run on page load and appear in the console.

[x] Apply event listeners to HTML form elements

[x] Use scope to control what variables are accessible inside functions and blocks

#### Design 
[x] Use CSS grid to create complex layouts

[x] Use CSS grid to make layouts that adapt to the viewport size


### Planning

We took inspiration from ``Google Keep``

We created a logo using DALL.E
